## Project expectations

-   Handout: Github repository private or public.

-   A clear README on how to reproduce the scraper/API program.

-   Key is to make it reproducible: I should be able to clone the repository and execute whatever you need to me to produce the scraper.

-   Document what the output is, where it is saved and what each script in the program does.

## Project expectations

-   The idea is for some medium-hard scraping/API projects.

    -   Scrape several sources of information

    -   Same website or combining several websites

    -   Meaningful dataset / Something that might help you on another class

    -   **Remember most of the mark is for this project.** 

-   API Projects: tokens should not be hosted on your repository. Provide clear instructions where to place tokens for reproducibility.

## Project expectations

<br>

Project ideas should be consulted and approved by me before the deadline
